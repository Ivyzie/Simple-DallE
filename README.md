## **Simple GPT-4 Interface using API key**

**Honestly we can just use playground but DALL-E 3 isnt available in  Playground, so this has it.**
*This is a Flask app and I have no idea what am I doing*


## Use your own OpenAI API key please 

   Under app.py, and change the OPEN_API_KEY, VALID_USERNAME and VALID_PASSWORD
   

***Running the app***

> **`pip install -r requirements.txt`**
> for requirements lol
> 
> **`python app.py`**
> thats literally it

***Hosting on URL***

Open cmd and ssh to serveo.net, pretty cool website 
> **`ssh -R 80:localhost:<YOUR-PORT> serveo.net`**
> copy paste the url in the cmd

## Fun fact:
I did not write a single line of code, everything was from Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT4.
